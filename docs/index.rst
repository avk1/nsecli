Introduction
------------

NSE CLI is a command line interface to National Stock Exchange (NSE). It allows you to get fetch the detailed stock quote
in real time. The command line interface is many folds faster than the web interface (www.nseindia.com) becuase it does't 
have to download and render all the HTML and Java Script everytime you fetch the a stock quote.

This is an added convinience for the people who use unix/linux at their workplace, because they don't need to switch the 
window and for getting the market updates.
