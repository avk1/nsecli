This work is in progress ....
Introduction
--------------

This is a command line application contained in one file which provides basic CLI interface to query National Stock Exchange (NSE) data. As a user you can get the live quotes of the stocks on your linux terminal.

It is very user friendly and doesn't require you to remember any stock codes. It provides a fuzzy search algorithm through which you can find the stock code by typing few characters of the company name or its code.

Benefits Over Web Interface
---------------------------

Main benefit over web interface is the speed at which it can fetch data. It also saves a lot of network bandwith since it doesn't have to download all the images typically found on a web page and doesn't have to parse the heavy duty java script.

On an average it only requires 300 mili seconds to get the quote of one stock. Though it is expected to vary based on the network speed and server response.

(also it makes you look like as if you are busy working on some unixy stuff !!)


Platform Support
-----------------
Currently it is tested only linux platform, but nothing stops it working on Windows or Mac. If someone can test it on Mac or Windows and suggest me changes which are required, then it will be great.
